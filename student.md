## Prospective graduate students
Thank you for considering to join my group! 

I am always looking for students to work with me in the areas of trustworthy machine learning, specifically fairness, privacy, robustness and explianability.
Note that it's very important that you and I are a good match. Once we start working together, we will be working very closely for at least 2 yrs (for M.Sc.) and 4 years (for Ph.D.).

I hire students at:
- the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/)
- the [Department of Computer Science and Operations Research](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/)(DIRO) at [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/)

First, check the department's application deadline and make sure the start time you are about to email me for is still feasible. For Fall semester, if you are interested in doing a PhD, Master or internship with me, please apply **first** through the [Mila admission website](https://mila.quebec/en/cours/supervision/) and put in your selection there that you are interested in working with me (Deadline December 1, 2021). If your application is succesful and pass the internal evaluation, I will contact you and invite you for an interview.

Second, note that it's hard to evaluate your application by just looking at your CV. In your email to express your interest in applying to work with me, please do the following. 

- Highlight **why** you are intrested to work with me. Check my reserach interests and read at least one of my recent papers and let me know which paper you read and ask one or more questions that came to your mind when you read it. Feel free to let me know what you liked/disliked about the paper;
- Highlight any research experience you have (if any);
- Highlight any scholarships you've been awarded or applied for
- A copy of your CV and transcripts
- A copy of a report, article, or paper you wrote (if any). 
- For students with an advanced degree (e.g., Master's), please mention who your Master's thesis advisor is.

**Note that I receive hundreds of requests like these and unfortnunately I cannot gaurantee to reply individually**. However, I do review what you send me carefully. Please **do not send me an email about your application more than once**.
