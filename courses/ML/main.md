# Machine Learning for Large-Scale Data Analysis and Decision Making (MATH80629A): Fall 2021

## Course Description
Welcome to MATH80629A Graduate level course on introduction to machine learning at HEC Montreal (English edition). This is the English edition of the course, for the French edition, please check [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~lcharlin/courses/80-629/).
In this course, we will study machine learning models, a type of statistical analysis that focuses on prediction, for analyzing very large datasets ("big data").
The plan is to survey different machine learning techniques (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning) as well as some applications (e.g., recommender systems). We will also study large-scale machine learning and will discuss distributed computational frameworks (Hadoop and Spark).


## Course Format
Due to the online nature of the semester, this course will be given as a [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom). It is an instructional strategy where students learn the material before they come to class. The material will be a mix of readings and video capsules. Class time is reserved for more active activities such as problem solving, demonstrations, and questions-answering. In addition, class time will contain a short summary of the week's material.

## Time & room
- Mondays 8:30 am - 11:30 am
- room: [Manuvie](https://www.hec.ca/en/campus/buildings/cote_sainte_catherine/1st_floor/classrooms/manuvie.html). This classroom is located on the 1st floor of Côte-Sainte-Catherine building.
- online: [zoom link](https://hecmontreal.zoom.us/j/89872470099?pwd=UkxrZ2dLbU9jWE9UR1UwZy9UeXpIdz09). Rooms are password-protected. Reach out to me by email if you need the password.

## Prerequisites
Mathematical maturity and basic knowledge of statistics, and probability will be assumed. 
For the programming assignments and the project, Python programming will be assumed. If you do not know Python here are few ways to learn the basics below. 

- [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/onboarding/create_account?track_id=17): Complete Chapters 1, 2, 3 (sign in using this [link](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/d8833e84f66e8de38ca3de07987087f93561cfd2b03a636c6d0156a699e8de50) with you @hec.ca email address to access Chapters 2 and 3). **This option is recommended**
- [HEC CAM]() offers introductory python courses in September (currently only in French). Register at [CAM registration](https://inscription.hec.ca/cams/).
- [Fall 2018 tutorial](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~lcharlin/courses/80-629/tutorial_f18.html). This will give you an idea of the level that is expected for this course.  

Further a machine-learning tutorial using python will be provided on [week #5](lectures.md).

## Grading
Your final score for the course will be computed using the following weights:

- [Homework](homework.md) (20%)
- [Capsule quizes](homework.md)  (10%)
- [Project](project.md) (30%)
- [Project presentation](project.md) (10%)
- Final Exam (30%)
